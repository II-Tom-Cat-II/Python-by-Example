Basic python problems used to practice and familiarize with coding in python


These problems are coded using Jupyter Notebook.

Here are some of the Jupyter Notebook shorcuts for reference:

Ctrl: command key ⌘
Shift: Shift ⇧
Alt: option ⌥

There are 2 modes in the Jupyter Notebook App: command mode and edit mode. 

Shortcuts in both modes:

Shift + Enter run the current cell, select below

Ctrl + Enter run selected cells

Alt + Enter run the current cell, insert below

Ctrl + S save and checkpoint

While in command mode (press Esc to activate):

D, D (press the key twice) delete selected cells

Z undo cell deletion
